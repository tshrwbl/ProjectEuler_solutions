Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

num = 2
temp = 1
answer = 2 //addition of all even turms
	
for numbers less than 4000000
	num += temp
	if num % 2 == 0
		answer += num
	temp = num - temp
	
print answer
