If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

for number from 0 to 1000
	if number % 3 == 0
	
		sum += num
	
	if number % 5 == 0
	
		sum += num
	
	if number% 15 == 0
	
		sum -= num
print summation
